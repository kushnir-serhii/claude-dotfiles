# ALMA — Mindfulness & Ambient Audio App

A **mobile-first design prototype** for a meditation and ambient audio application. Built as a static web app running entirely in the browser — no build step, no backend — to allow rapid visual iteration on UI/UX before any native implementation.

---

## What this is

ALMA is a **visual design prototype**, not a production app. The goal is to define and refine:

- The complete screen-by-screen UI of a mobile meditation app
- Interaction patterns (navigation, sheets, pickers, players)
- The design language: typography, color, motion, spacing
- The data model: what concepts the app tracks (tracks, rituals, sessions, user progress)

The prototype runs inside a simulated iOS device frame in a browser. When the design is validated, the screens and interactions serve as the spec for building the real app in React Native, SwiftUI, or another mobile stack.

---

## Running the app

Open `ALMA.html` with a local HTTP server. The simplest option:

- **VS Code Live Server** — right-click `ALMA.html` → Open with Live Server
- **Python** — `python -m http.server 5500` in `alma-locket/`, then open `http://localhost:5500/ALMA.html`

No install, no build. The file loads React 18 and Babel from CDN and compiles JSX in the browser.

## Features

### Sanctuary (Home)
The main discovery screen. Shows:
- **Master Tracks** — a horizontal scroll of curated meditation audio cards (artwork orb + title + duration). Tapping opens a quick-config sheet to set duration and launch.
- **Your Rituals** — saved session presets with a track + ambient layer combination. One tap to launch.
- **Pinned Files** — user-uploaded audio files pinned to the home screen for quick access.
- Theme toggle (Moon / Sun) in the header.

### Mixer
Custom session builder. The user:
1. Picks a **Focus Track** (main audio)
2. Adds an **Ambient Layer** (continuous background sound: rain, ocean, bowls, etc.)
3. Adds a **Bell** (session marker — intro/outro or interval)
4. Sets **Duration** and **Interval** (how often the bell rings)
5. Launches the session or saves it as a Ritual

### Vault
Personal library management:
- **Rituals** — list of saved presets; rename or delete them; tap to launch
- **My Files** — user-uploaded raw audio files; pin/unpin to Sanctuary; customise cover art and icon; delete

### Profile
User identity and progress tracking:
- **Hero** — day-of-week lotus image (Mon=lotus_1 … Sun=lotus_7) with a breathing animation. Stage title changes with the day: Awakening Bud → Unfolding Layers → First Petals → Opening Heart → Radiant Flower → Sacred Bloom → Infinite Essence.
- **Weekly Stats** — total meditation time this week, 7-day GitHub-style streak heatmap (squares colored by minutes per day), weekly goal progress bar (gradient fill).
- **Account Settings** — editable display name, daily session goal picker (5/10/15/20/30 min), weekly goal picker (30m/1h/1.5h/2h/3h).
- **Statistics link** — opens the full Statistics screen.
- **Plan badge** — Free/Pro indicator with Upgrade button.
- **Account actions** — Log Out, Delete Account (confirm-gated).

### Statistics Screen
Full-screen overlay showing:
- 2×2 summary tiles: Total Time, Sessions, Avg Session, This Week
- Weekly goal progress card (current week, gradient bar, % complete)
- Past weeks history (5 weeks of bars)

### Full Player
Immersive session view:
- Animated mandala (breathing concentric rings, color-keyed to accent)
- Track artwork orb
- Countdown timer with scrub bar
- Play/pause, mute, collapse to mini-player
- Save current session as a Ritual
- Customize (jump to Mixer with current track loaded)

### Mini Player
Persistent pill above the tab bar showing current track, elapsed/total, play/pause toggle, close.

## Design language

### Themes
Two modes switchable via the header toggle on Sanctuary:

| Token | Moon (dark espresso) | Sun (light sand) |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-0` | `#0E0B09` | `#F6F1EA` |
| `--text` | `#F4F1EC` | `#2B2118` |
| `--surface` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.045)` | `rgba(43,33,24,0.05)` |

The accent color (`--accent`) defaults to indigo `#4839F4` and is user-selectable (5 presets via the Tweaks panel).

### Typography
`Outfit` (Google Fonts) — weights 300/400/500/600/700. Warm-neutral, geometric, readable at small mobile sizes.

### Motion
- `breathe` — slow scale oscillation (1.0 → 1.04), used on the lotus hero image and mandala
- `almaFade` — opacity 0 → 1 for screen transitions
- `almaFadeUp` — opacity 0 + translateY(12px) → full, for list items
- `press` CSS class — `scale(0.96)` on active for tactile button feedback

### Icons
All icons are hand-built Lucide-style SVGs via a `_lucide(children)` factory:
- `stroke="currentColor"`, `strokeWidth: 1.8`, `fill: none`, `viewBox: "0 0 24 24"`
- No emoji anywhere in the UI

### Cover art system
The `ALMA_GRADIENTS` map provides backgrounds for track orbs:
- **Image covers** — `.webp` files for master tracks (atmospheric photo-paintings)
- **Gradient images** — `gradient1.webp` … `gradient6.webp` for rituals and progress states
- **CSS gradients** — inline radial/linear gradients for ambient layers and pin-file thumbnails

### Important: single-file architecture

`ALMA.html` is **the authoritative running file**. All `.jsx` source files are mirrors kept in sync with it. Every component is inlined in order inside one `<script type="text/babel">` block:

```
data → icons → components → mandala → player → sanctuary →
mixer → vault → tweaks → ios-frame → stats → profile → app
```

When editing, change `ALMA.html` and keep the corresponding `.jsx` mirror in sync. The `.jsx` files are for readability and version control diffs — they are not imported or bundled.

## Architecture notes

### React hook aliasing
Because all components share one Babel script block, `const { useState }` can only be declared once per block scope. Each screen section aliases the hooks it needs:

| Section | Aliases |
|---|---|
| App | `useStateA`, `useEffectA`, `useRefA` |
| Player | `useStateP`, `useEffectP`, `useRefP` |
| Sanctuary | `useStateS` |
| Profile | `useStateProf`, `useEffectProf`, `useRefProf` |
| … | pattern repeats per section |

### Audio engine
`useAudioEngine()` in `app.jsx` manages two `<audio>` elements (main track + ambient layer). Volumes are fixed at 0.85 (main) and 0.45 (layer). Bells use short-lived `new Audio()` instances so they never interrupt the main session.

### State persistence
User preferences stored in `localStorage`:
- `alma-name` — display name
- `alma-goal` — daily session goal (minutes)
- `alma-weekly-goal` — weekly goal (minutes)
- `alma-theme` — `'moon'` | `'sun'`

### Overlay z-index stack
```
Tab bar          z-index: 40
Stats screen     z-index: 50
Mini player      z-index: 30 (above scrollbody)
Full player      z-index: 60 (deck slide-up)
Sheets           z-index: 70
Toast            z-index: 80
```

## Data model (prototype/mock)

All data is hardcoded in `data.jsx`. In a real app these would come from an API or local database.

```
MASTER_TRACKS     — curated audio tracks available in the library
SAVED_RITUALS     — user's saved session presets (track + layer + duration)
AMBIENT_LAYERS    — ambient background sounds and session bells
RAW_AUDIO         — user's own uploaded files (pin-able to Sanctuary)
WEEK_SESSION_DATA — mock 7-day history (minutes per day, Mon–Sun)
WEEKLY_HISTORY    — mock 5-week history for the Statistics screen
LIFETIME_STATS    — mock total sessions and total minutes
PROGRESS_STATES   — 7 stage titles mapped to lotus images (one per day of week)
```

## Extending the prototype

When adding a new screen or feature:

1. Add any new data constants to `data.jsx` and the `Object.assign(window, {...})` at the bottom
2. Add any new icons to `icons.jsx` using `_lucide(<path ... />)`
3. Write the component in a new `.jsx` mirror file
4. Paste it into `ALMA.html` in the correct position in the inline script block (maintain dependency order)
5. Wire it into `app.jsx` (new tab, new state, or new overlay)
6. Use unique hook aliases (`useStateFoo`) to avoid block-scope conflicts
